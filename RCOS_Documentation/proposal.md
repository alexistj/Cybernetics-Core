# Cybernetics Core Proposal

Current project members:
* Owen Lockwood
* Mack Qian 

## Description
Cybernetics core is a RCOS project designed to explore AI and video games. The long term end goal of this project is to make a highly competative
StartCraft 2 AI. Utilizing Blizzard's S2Client API, and existing python libraries, a AI bot will be made using Python and C++ (what the
client API is written in). Some key areas that will be important to this project are Python, C++, the S2Client API, Artificial Intelligence,
Machine Learning, Video games, and more. 

While during this first semester a large amount of background knowledge must be acquired (both advancing python and C++ knowledge and advancing
AI and the existing API code), below are some objectives that we hope to complete this semester.
## Milestones
 1. Simple games/objectives will be demonstrated using AI and the documentation on this will not only help inform the project as it continues but also others learning AI and video games (likely in python)
 2.	While working in Python making simple games and AIs, C++ skills will be acquired.
 3.	The SC2 API will be set up to be usable and further documentation will be made to expand upon what Blizzard has already provided
 4.	It will be demonstrated that the API works and that a game can be created and launched vs humans and other bots
 5.	A simple bot will be made, with a pre-programmed strategy. E.g. worker rush, cannon rush, mass mutalisk, etc.
 6.	(Potentially) A simple bot will be made utilizing techniques learned from the earlier exploratory phase
 7.	For future semesters, this bot can constantly be improved upon and more AI techniques and training can be involved

Note: These may not be the exact order of these events
